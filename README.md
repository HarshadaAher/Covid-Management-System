## Database Design:
Database design is the most important in this project. We are storing
details of patients using database system. Data stored: Patient’s name,
Doctor’s name, Hospital name, Gender, Mobile number, Swab number, Date of
sample taken, Report.
The Patient data is stored by Patient name and thus it is very easy to
search the details of patient.

## Conclusion:
After the completion of the project one can clearly say that our
developed application will help a lot in this pandemic situation. This project is
user friendly and easy to handle.

## Thank you..
